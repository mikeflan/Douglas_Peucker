Douglas-Peucker polyline simplification algorithm. First draws single line
from start to end. Then finds largest deviation from this straight line, and if
greater than tolerance, includes that point, splitting the original line into
two new lines. Repeats recursively for each new line created.

Data::Douglas_Peucker processes a list of 2 dimensional 
data and reduces the number of records in the list using 
the Douglas/Peucker algoritm.  So it produces a set of 
2 dimensional data that is reduced in number, but 
approximates the original set.


A typical application is to reduce a set of 2 dimensional
points that fall along a curve to a smaller set of 
2 dimensional points that approximates the same curve.
An example of this is a GPS track (waypoints along a 
GPS track).

Note that the value assigned to $tolerance is roughly the 
number of meters distance that a point can be from the straight
line drawn between two latitude/longitude points, one on each side, 
and the point can be discarded.  So a higher number used for 
$tolerance removes more points from the original set of lat/longs.
